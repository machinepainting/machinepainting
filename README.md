# 👋 Sup, I’m @machinepainting

🎨 I'm a commercial artist by day, vampire coder by night. Currently focused on exploring, learning, and building AI-based creator tools.

🧠 I'm passionate about bridging the gap between technology and the arts through innovation and collaboration.

🌱 I'm currently diving deeper into Automation, AI Based Creator Tools, Cloud Computing, and expaning my coding knowledge in both Python and Javascript.

🤝 I'm always interested in meeting and collaborating with both technically advanced developers and fellow creative artists to further the potential of creative tools.

📫 Dont be a stranger. Hit me up with an email to talk shop. Reach me @ → machinepainting@proton.me

🚀 Let’s meet and build the future of creative design together!
